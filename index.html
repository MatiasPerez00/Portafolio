            <p>I am a student of Systems Engineering with a deep passion for programming, which began with my first
                encounter with C++. This language sparked a profound interest in the world of development, leading me to
                explore and learn about various tools and technologies. My curiosity has driven me to expand my
                knowledge through in-person courses, online platforms like YouTube, and technical documentation,
                enhancing my programming skills and expertise.</p>
            <p>I have competed in programming tournaments, where I had the chance to connect with other professionals
                and learn about the implementation of new technologies. These experiences have allowed me to observe how
                websites and applications are optimized, keeping me updated with the latest trends and methodologies in
                the tech field.</p>
            <p>Currently, I am seeking job opportunities in the technology sector that will allow me to face new
                challenges and apply my acquired knowledge. I am continuing my university studies while looking for a
                position that offers the chance to further my learning and professional development. My goal is to
                combine practical experience with my academic background to contribute to advancements in the technology
